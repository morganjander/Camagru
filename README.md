 <h1>Architecture</h1>
 The application follows a typical Model-View-Controller pattern: The model is an object that represents the data or state of an application, as well as the rules governing access to and updates of that data. The view is a visualisation of the content of the current state of the model. The controller is how the user interacts with the application; it translates user input into changes made to the model reflected in the view.
